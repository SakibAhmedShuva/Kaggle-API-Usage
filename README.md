# Kaggle API Usage

A comprehensive guide and toolkit for interacting with the Kaggle API to streamline your data science workflow.

## Overview

This repository provides examples, utilities, and best practices for using the Kaggle API to:
- Download datasets and competitions
- Submit competition entries
- Manage and update kernels
- Search and explore available resources
- Automate repetitive tasks

## Installation

```bash
# Install the Kaggle API package
pip install kaggle

# Set up your API credentials
mkdir -p ~/.kaggle
# Place your kaggle.json file in the ~/.kaggle directory
# Ensure proper permissions
chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
```

## Authentication Setup

1. Create a Kaggle account at [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com)
2. Go to your account settings â†’ API section
3. Click "Create New API Token" to download your `kaggle.json` file
4. Place this file in the `~/.kaggle/` directory (create it if it doesn't exist)
5. Set appropriate permissions: `chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json`

## Features

### Downloading Datasets
```python
# Download a specific dataset
kaggle datasets download -d username/dataset-name

# List available datasets
kaggle datasets list -s keyword
```

### Competition Workflows
```python
# List active competitions
kaggle competitions list

# Download competition data
kaggle competitions download -c competition-name

# Submit to a competition
kaggle competitions submit -c competition-name -f submission.csv -m "Submission message"
```

### Kernel Management
```python
# List your kernels
kaggle kernels list

# Push updates to a kernel
kaggle kernels push username/kernel-name
```

## Example Scripts

The `examples/` directory contains ready-to-use scripts for common tasks:
- `download_dataset.py`: Template for downloading and extracting datasets
- `competition_workflow.py`: End-to-end competition workflow
- `batch_download.py`: Download multiple datasets in batch
- `automated_submission.py`: Automate the submission process

## Best Practices

- **Security**: Never commit your `kaggle.json` file to version control
- **Rate Limiting**: Be mindful of API rate limits
- **Large Downloads**: Use the `--unzip` flag for automatic extraction
- **Automation**: Consider using the API in CI/CD pipelines for team workflows

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions:
- **Authentication errors**: Verify your `kaggle.json` file is correctly placed and has proper permissions
- **Download failures**: Check your internet connection and available disk space
- **API limits**: Space out requests if you encounter rate limiting
